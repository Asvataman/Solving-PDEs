# Solving PDEs using data driven models

This Repo contains my Internship works. It involves Solving PDE(Partial Differential Equations) using Neural Networks. For this instance Navier-Stokes Equation is used. For Further details and explanations to the code can be found in Report.pdf. The Abstract is given below for reference.

Abstract:

Most engineering design problems have an objective function and a set of constraints on parameters. One may solve the problem using Simulation models based on Numerical methods. Since a design problem involves experimentation, in case of change in the parameters the simulation needed to be generated again. Surrogate modelling is an engineering method in which a mathematical model, which is represents the true case as accurate as needed, is used to get the required result.


Surrogate modelling is crucial, as in a real life problem a single simulation may take hours or days to complete and any change in the design parameters requires a new simulation. Although generating or modelling a surrogate for the problem is also time demanding process, once modelled a problem will require almost
no time to produce Output. As almost all Physical problem can be represented as a Partial Differential Equation(PDE) the objective of the internship is to
create a surrogate model for a PDE based system. 

The internship was begun by solving a simple Quadratic Equation using surrogate modelling by various methods. By the knowledge gained on studying surrogate modelling of a quadratic equation it is implemented to solve PDEs.
